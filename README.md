# Tarot-Website

Website showcasing AI drawn tarot cards

## Description

* I and the associated graphic designer created this project out of passion. As you may have noticed, this project is heavily influenced by elements from the Italian writer Dante Alighieri's 14th-century epic poem Divine Comedy, as well as some elements from anime.

* I am still on my learning journey as a front-end web developer, and this project was created as a means of practice. I have realised that some self-taught webdevelopers make some generic websites, and this website started as a deck of cards to practice, but I felt like the idea of making the typical deck of cards was sort of a generic idea without much room for imagination, and typically I like to put my own touch on my projects or everyday practice, so I thought of tarot cards.

* Yes, tarot cards aren't exactly an original idea, but I thought it could be a little different, and incorporating AI technology to draw the cards seemed like the extra push of originality I needed. This project wasn't created with the intention of gaining insight into the past, present, or future through the reading of tarot cards, but just exploring something new for me.
